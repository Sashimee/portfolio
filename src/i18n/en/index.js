        title: "Introduction",
        paragraphs: [
          "Fintechs, companies operating in the field of financial technologies, like many other entities in our modern world, are fundamentally dependent on their IT structure. Within this structure, we find the programming code that is essential to its activity. It is this very code that directly generates a major part of the greenhouse gas emissions emitted by this industry",
          "<strong>Green Coding</strong> is a different, efficient approach to IT development that aims for sustainability. This method requires the creation of computer algorithms that consume a minimum of energy. With the constant increase in digitalisation and all IT needs, the use of data centres will also increase."

      {
        title: "What exactly is <strong>Green Coding</strong>?",
        paragraphs: [
          "<strong>Green Coding</strong> is a recent term popularised by various organisations for their intention to conserve the environment. It enables coders, programmers, developers and engineers to take a more ecological view of the algorithms they create. To this end, they need to take two major factors into account:",
          "- Structural considerations: These are directly linked to the blocks of code and the infrastructure that surrounds them",
          "- Behavioural considerations: Linked to the usage scenario, for example consulting the LinkedIn feed, sending an e-mail, etc.",
          "Code designers therefore need to review existing practices, improve what is already in place and design new methods that balance functionality and energy use."

      {
        title: "<strong>Green Coding</strong> and Fintech",
        paragraphs: [
          "Fintech has grown very rapidly and continuously. It has transformed the way we do financial transactions, whether for payments, loans, investments or even insurance. However, like any technology, fintech has an environmental impact. The servers that power these services consume large amounts of energy, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions",
          "So that's where <strong>Green Coding</strong> comes in. By optimising the code that powers these financial services, we can reduce the amount of energy needed to run them. This can be done in a number of ways, for example by reducing the number of lines of code, optimising algorithms to run faster and using more energy-efficient programming languages."

      },
      {
        title: "Applications of <strong>Green Coding</strong> in Fintech",
        paragraphs: [
          "The application of these principles in Fintech can take several forms. For example, companies can optimise their applications so that they consume less energy when used on mobile devices. This may involve making the application more responsive, reducing the amount of data it uses or ensuring that it does not use the device's resources unnecessarily",
          "In addition, companies can also seek to make their data centres greener. Through the use of more energy efficient servers, optimising the use of servers to reduce energy wastage, or even using renewable energy to power data centres.",
          "Finally, <strong>Green Coding</strong> can also involve the use of greener blockchain technologies. Blockchain is a key technology in many fintech services, but it is also notorious for its high energy consumption. However, there are greener alternatives; technologies that consume much less energy than those used by blockchains, such as Bitcoin."

        title: "<strong>Green Coding</strong> challenges in Fintech",
        paragraphs: [
          "Although <strong>Green Coding</strong> offers many advantages, it also presents challenges. Firstly, it can be difficult to measure the energy efficiency of a code. This is because energy efficiency can depend on many factors, such as the hardware on which the code is run, the way the code is written, and even the way the user interacts with the application.",
          "In addition, it can be difficult to convince companies to invest in <strong>Green Coding</strong>. Although it can cut costs in the long term by reducing energy consumption, it may require an initial investment to rewrite or optimise existing code.",
          "Finally, it can also be difficult to find developers with the necessary skills. <strong>Green Coding</strong> is a relatively new skill, and it can be difficult to find developers who have both fintech experience and knowledge of <strong>Green Coding</strong>."

        img: "challenges"
      },
      {
        title: "Conclusion",
        paragraphs: [
          "Despite these challenges, <strong>Green Coding</strong> has enormous potential to transform the fintech industry. By reducing the energy consumption of financial services, we can not only reduce our environmental impact, but also make these services more accessible. After all, less energy means less cost, which can mean lower fees for users.",
          "<strong>Green Coding</strong> is still an emerging practice, but with time and investment, it has the potential to become the norm in the fintech industry. By investing in <strong>Green Coding</strong> now, companies can not only reduce their environmental impact, but also position themselves as leaders in an industry that is increasingly conscious of its environmental impact."
